Not so much performance scaling by limiting the hardware.
We can look at how the solution quality scales with time and problem size.
This also shows strengths of the GPU -> bigger problems on the GPU are faster

So we need an array of sizes, then we can see how time scales
We can also see how solution quality scales when trying to keep a similar time
